## 🎧 Outside the Code

I come from a creative background — before coding, I spent nearly a decade producing music.

- 🎵 I’ve produced **hip hop, trap, and afrobeats**, with some of my work going viral on social media and playing on international radios like **BBC Radio 1**. One of my proudest moments was releasing a collaborative album with my cousin — who’s also my best friend and a rapper.  
- 🎸 I play guitar, dabble with piano and bass, and still make music casually to clear my mind and stay inspired.  
- 🎮 I’ve always loved games — from **GTA San Andreas** and **Modern Warfare** to **board games like Catan and Carcassonne**. Game design and storytelling have a big influence on my passion for UI/UX.  
- 🎬 A big fan of comedy films (especially **French comedies**) and documentaries.  
- ⌚ I’m a watch enthusiast — vintage timepieces and automatic watches fascinate me. Even got a soft spot for Casios.  
- ⚽ I’ve played golf since I was 5, hit the gym regularly, and still play football every week.  
- 📸 I also explore **photography and videography** in my free time.  
- 🐕 Dog person through and through — proud companion of a German Shepherd.
